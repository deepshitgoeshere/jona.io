Recently it came to my attention that the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors
is electing two members to represent the individual membership (not backed
by any companies, and not from the TSC/CTC). This is my application for just
that.

### Why me?

I am a part of the soon-to-be [Inclusivity Working Group](http://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity)
that seeks to improve diversity and equality within the user base and collaborator base of
the project. I am also part of the website collaboration team, and have made
contributions to both projects.

I have been using Node.js for the last four years now, and, having explored a wide
variety of programming techniques, libraries and technologies, have a very
good grip of the framework and its tooling. I have built multiple production-ready
applications from scratch, but have also worked on tools that integrate with
other technologies, such as Redis, Ruby on Rails or PostgreSQL. This entire site
is even statically compiled using Node.js, including all parts of it, such as
this blog or my resume.

As for me personally, I am 16 years old and currently live in Germany, where I
am undergoing efforts to finish my school education, after which I will be
starting an apprenticeship at [Codecentric](http://codecentric.de), an IT agency
based in DÃ¼sseldorf. Personally, I do not think that my age is supposed to be
a barrier from participating in occasions such as these, which is one reason
why I joined the Inclusivity group, having experienced a lot of discrimination
because of my age in local groups and over the internet.
