As if Node.js wasn't enough, I won't be using GitHub anymore.

Of course, I can't entirely flee from it. A bunch of projects that I work on or
contribute to are still there. But I'll be moving the repositories that I
personally maintain, like my website, to BitBucket, from which I'll also start
future projects.

As for my reasoning, it's pretty simple. GitHub is too much of a social network
for my liking. It also enforces some pretty ugly conventions, and, for my taste,
is pretty strict in enforcing those. An example of this is the 'WebM for
Retards'-case, where a fully functional project got taken down by GitHub without
prior notice (read more about this [here](https://pipedot.org/article/FE7Z)).

If you want to see what I'm doing over at BitBucket, you can [visit my profile](http://bitbucket.org/trait)
there.
