description: Moving away from Node and Ruby.

_Alternatively titled: Why I Am The Best At Puns_

This is a blog post about me saying that I will not use Node.js in the next
months, published on a platform built in Node.js, written in an editor built in
Node.js, listening to music on an application built in Node.js.

Yes, the gist is that I will refrain (or at least try to) from using Node.js
_and_ Ruby. This is because I want to focus more on working with, and learning,
functional languages such as Elixir. I also want to get into Erlang and OTP
since it appears to be a very powerful and fast engine.

I will continue working on projects that I (help) maintain, such as marblesoda
or Wind Up, but nothing more of that sort.

This is the end of this blog post.
