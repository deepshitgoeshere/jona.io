In your heart, you know it's true. There's no such thing as a _good_ or even _best_ language.

Some might want to punch their computers and scream: _"Blasphemy! Everyone knows that [LANGUAGE X] is the best! It has [FEATURES Y AND Z]!"_. Doesn't this sound awfully familiar to you? I'm sure you've heard that, if not exact, similar phrasing shout out by some random guy on the internet in response to you claiming that [LANGUAGE X] isn't actually as good as everyone says.

There's really no good way to talk around this, but every language is usually focused on a different __paradigm__. Examples of paradigms include object-oriented (which Java and Ruby are quite good at), imperative programming (first employed by the VERY early languages such as B or even Speedcoding) or, the latest craze, functional programming (the most notable example being Haskell, which is dubbed my many as _"the new Javascript"_ already).

Why am I telling you this? Thing is, there's more than these three paradigms. How many, you ask? __About 100.__ Yeah, that's a lot. There's nondeterministic programming, for example, which can decide between multiple ways to go through the program, deviating from the usual top-to-bottom approach. It's employed in languages such as Prolog or a Lisp dialect called [Alisp](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/aaai02-alisp.pdf).

Lots of paradigms mean lots of languages (_hundreds_) that embody these. Javascript, for example, takes concepts from imperative, object-oriented and functional (and probably even more that I don't know) paradigms and mixes these together to create the quite unique blend that makes it special. But a Haskell does functional programming better, Ruby does object-oriented programming better, 
Assembly does imperative programming better, yadda yadda. But, while Haskell might be the _"purest"_ functional language around, it's lacking in other aspects.

What I'm saying by this is that there's no perfect language that combines ALL paradigms and there will never be one. This is why one language isn't _better_ than the rest. Truthfully, it might be better than another one in some aspects, but it's not the _best_ or objectively _good_ (subjectively, yes, very much, and everyone seems to want to point that out).

At the end of the day, keep on doing your thing. I like to use some languages more than others because I prefer their employment of certain paradigms combined with their syntax and maybe even their tooling, but none of them I'd consider _good_ or _the best_.
